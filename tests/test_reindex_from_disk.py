"""Disaster recovery: `pipeline.reindex_bis_from_disk` hash-matching path.

The scenario this function exists for is "the manifest was reset/lost while
tens of thousands of downloaded speech PDFs accumulated on disk". The files
are still there, but every bit of metadata that made them findable — the exact
publication date, the source URL — lived only in the manifest. Re-downloading
is not an option (weeks of crawling); instead the function re-derives the join
by recomputing each speech's stable `doc_id = sha1("<bank>|C1|<pdf_url>")[:16]`
from the BIS sitemaps and looking for a file already named that.

That whole path had no test, so nothing pinned the hash basis, the per-bank
manifest destination, or the dry-run contract. The BIS sitemaps here are
hand-written XML in the real schema (a sitemap index pointing at one yearly
`sitemap_documents_YYYY.xml`) — small enough to read, and it is the *matching*
that is under test, not the parser (covered in tests/test_recovery.py).
