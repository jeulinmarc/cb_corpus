"""Bundesbank Discussion Papers (de D1) — `discover_buba_wp` end to end.

Saved-fixture style (mirrors tests/test_bdf_wp.py). The fixtures under
tests/fixtures/buba/ are real `bbksearch` result pages captured 2026-09-02
from the endpoint the code itself requests,
`https://www.bundesbank.de/action/en/732408/bbksearch?pageNumString=N`
(saved whole, nothing edited):
- bbksearch_page0.html   (N=0):   the newest 10 papers. Every item links only a
  `/discussion-papers/<slug>-<id>` page — NO direct blob — so this page is the
  fixture for the "fetch the paper's own page" branch.
- bbksearch_page120.html (N=120): 1999-2000 papers, every item linking a direct
  `…/YYYY-MM-DD-dkp-NN-data.pdf` blob (the no-fetch branch). It also carries
  the German/English pair of DP 05/1999 pointing at the SAME blob — real
  duplicate `(num, year)` keys, so dedup is exercised on real markup.
- bbksearch_page121.html (N=121): the next page (1997-1999), four more
  German/English duplicate pairs. Serving 120 then 121 as pages 0 and 1 gives
  a real two-page walk whose second page is strictly older than the first.
- detail_dkp_22_2026.html: the real paper page for DP 22/2026 "Collateral
  policy surprises" (…/discussion-papers/collateral-policy-surprises-957108),
  carrying the og:title and the blob PDF the listing page does not.

`discover_buba_wp` was previously reached by no test at all (it was only ever
monkeypatched away), so the pagination, branch, cutoff and dedup behaviour it
promises in its docstring was unverified. No live network in these tests.
