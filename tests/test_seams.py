"""Seam tests: pin the wiring BETWEEN independently-tested layers.

A cold audit found three layers stitched together with no test exercising the
join itself:
  1. `native_only`: CLI flag -> pipeline.run -> adapter.discover_all(kwarg).
  2. `skip_url` binding in run_repec: asserted callable somewhere, but never
     which index (`storage.is_known_source_url` vs the adjacent, semantically
     different `storage.is_known_url`).
Each layer already has its own unit tests; these tests only cover the seam.
