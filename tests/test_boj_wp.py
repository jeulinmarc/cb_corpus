"""Bank of Japan Working Paper Series (jp D1) — `discover_boj_wp` year walk.

Saved-fixture style (mirrors tests/test_bdf_wp.py). The fixtures under
tests/fixtures/boj/ are the real year listings captured 2026-09-02 from
`https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev/wps_{YYYY}/index.htm` — the exact
URLs the code builds — saved whole and unedited: wps_2026.html (14 papers),
wps_2025.html (13) and wps_2024.html (24).

`discover_boj_wp` was previously reached by no test (only `parse_wp_table`
was, on 3-line inline HTML): the year-by-year walk it wraps around the parser
— its order, its tolerance of a dead year, its `since` bound — was unverified.
No live network in these tests.
