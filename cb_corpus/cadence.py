"""Cadence watchdog — notices when a `(bank_code, doc_type)` series goes
SILENT (production review: fr D1 unnoticed 213 days, ecb D3 unnoticed 83).
Errors are logged by the sync path; silence was not — this module is the
weekly job that closes that gap.

Method: MEDIAN-GAP ONLY (spec `2026-08-24-cadence-watchdog.md` design
decision 1). A flat "docs per fixed window" statistic was tried first and
false-alarmed on lumpy quarterly series (ca E1, it/es D1 in the production
review): a series that bursts many documents on (or within a few days of)
one release date every ~90 days, then goes quiet, looks "empty" in any
individual short window even though it is perfectly on schedule.

The median gap is computed over DISTINCT CALENDAR DATES, not over raw
per-document rows. This is a deliberate structural choice, not a detail:
if N documents share (or nearly share) one release date, the doc-to-doc
gaps between them are ~0 and, for a bursty series, EASILY OUTNUMBER the
handful of genuine quarter-to-quarter gaps -- the median would then be
dragged down to ~0 days and next_expected would land the day after the
burst ends, reproducing the exact false-alarm this module exists to kill.
Deduplicating to distinct dates first means a same-day (or tightly
clustered) burst counts as ONE event, so the median reflects the real
release rhythm ("absorbs it naturally", per the design decision) instead
of the burst's internal density.

No network access anywhere in this module: it is pure computation over
`storage.iter_manifest_rows` (already-downloaded manifest data) plus the
`cadence_state.jsonl` state file it owns.
