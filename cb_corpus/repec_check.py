"""WP v3 phase 2 — RePEc/IDEAS completeness audit (never downloads).

Enumerates each wired IDEAS series (``SERIES`` in sources/repec.py) and asks: is
any paper missing from our manifest? Matching a RePEc paper to a manifest row,
in cascade:

  - **handle** — the IDEAS handle (e.g. RePEc:ecb:ecbwps:20253124) appears in a
    manifest row's ``source_url``/``repec_handle`` (exact for RePEc-sourced rows);
  - **key** — the bank-specific number (wp_migrate ``_KEY_FROM_HANDLE``) matches a
    native row's key (covers the 5 banks migrated off RePEc);
  - **title** — exact normalized title equality (last resort, unambiguous only).

Leftovers (RePEc papers no manifest row covers) are reported as `missing`, split
into `missing_recent` (within the last ~45 days → native discovery just hasn't
caught up / re-run it) and `missing_legacy` (older → ingest via RePEc + date
recovery). The reverse — manifest rows with no RePEc paper — is reported too
(`pending_repec` if recent, else `unmatched_old`). Stdout + CSV; no writes.

    Write rule (strict): a listing entry stamps its match ONLY when exactly

    distinct listing entries each uniquely resolve to the same row) -> the
    first entry stamps, every later one is ``ambiguous`` too — a doc_id can
    be stamped by at most one entry per run, so ``stamped`` counts, the CSV,
    and rows actually rewritten always agree. Ambiguous/unmatched/already

    doc_ids. Idempotent: once a row is stamped its IDEAS URL is a known
    source_url, so a second run finds it ``already`` and stamps 0.

    Returns {bank: {"stamped": n, "ambiguous": n, "already": n, "unmatched": n}}.
    Always writes a CSV (dry-run included) of every action taken, with rows
    ``{bank, ideas_url, action, doc_id, title}`` (doc_id/title empty when no
    single row was involved, e.g. ambiguous/unmatched).

    listing entry, rank up to 3 CANDIDATE manifest rows for the same bank

    incapable of writing. Entries whose candidate pool is empty (no eligible
    row at all for that bank) emit ONE CSV row with empty candidate fields
    rather than being silently dropped.

    """``--apply-csv``: reads a ``--propose`` CSV Marc has edited and stamps
    EXACTLY the pairs he approved. The similarity ``score`` column is never
    read here — only ``bank``/``ideas_url``/``candidate_doc_id`` (the human's
    decision) and ``approve`` (``x|yes|1|oui``, case/space-insensitive) drive
    this function, so a stray high-similarity row that Marc did NOT mark can
    never be written.

    This CSV is human-edited by hand, so it is treated as UNTRUSTED input,
    not a trusted machine artifact — every field is guarded before it can
    influence a write:

      - ``bank`` is stripped of surrounding whitespace before use (a stray
        space must not turn a valid bank into an unknown one); if a bank
        has NO manifest rows at all (typo, or genuinely empty), every row
        for it still gets the accurate ``row-gone`` skip reason, but ONE
        stderr warning (``unknown or empty bank '<x>' in apply CSV``) is
        also printed per distinct bad bank, so a systematic mistake is
        loud rather than silently absorbed into a pile of row-gone rows;
      - ``ideas_url`` must start with ``f"{IDEAS}/p/"`` (the only shape a
        real IDEAS paper page URL can take) else ``bad-ideas-url`` —
        this also closes an idempotence hole: an EMPTY ideas_url used to
        pass every other guard and get stamped as ``source_url=""``
        (falsy), so a re-apply of the same CSV saw ``source_url`` still
        "empty" and stamped again, forever — never converging;
      - the target row's ``doc_type`` must be ``D1``/``D2`` else
        ``bad-doc-type`` (a typo'd or hand-edited ``candidate_doc_id``
        must never stamp a row the reconciliation scope excludes).

    Every phase-1 invariant is ALSO re-validated against the LIVE manifest
    at apply time (never trusted from the propose pass, which may be
    stale), per approved row, in CSV order (first line wins ties — same
    rule as phase 1's reverse-ambiguity):

      - the doc_id still exists in the bank's manifest, else ``row-gone``;
      - its ``source_url`` is still empty, else ``source-not-empty`` (also
        what an idempotent re-apply of the same CSV hits: already stamped);
      - the doc_id was not already stamped by an earlier approved row IN
        THIS run, else ``duplicate-doc-id``;
      - the ideas_url was not already claimed by an earlier approved row IN
        THIS run, NOR already a known source_url elsewhere in the manifest
        (a stamp from phase 1 or an earlier apply run counts too), else
        ``duplicate-ideas-url``.

    An unapproved row is reported ``not-approved`` and never touched.

    The CSV is opened with ``encoding="utf-8-sig"`` so a BOM (common when a
    spreadsheet app re-saves the propose CSV) is stripped rather than
    corrupting the first column's header/value.

    Default is dry-run (``write=False``): the report CSV still shows every
    row that WOULD be applied/skipped (so it doubles as a preview), but
    ``_apply_stamps``/``storage.rewrite_manifest`` is never called — the
    manifest is byte-for-byte untouched. With ``write=True``, stamps go
    through the shared ``_apply_stamps`` (full row set, same as phase 1)
    once per bank touched. Returns ``{"applied": n, "skipped": n}``. Always
    writes a report CSV (columns: bank, ideas_url, doc_id, title, action,
    skip_reason) — ``applied`` lines in it equal actual manifest writes
    whenever ``write=True``.
