"""`sweep-orphans`: quarantine on-disk files that duplicate indexed documents.

An *orphan* is any regular file under ``raw/`` whose filename stem is not a
manifest ``doc_id``. Orphans exist because an earlier doc_id scheme named the
same documents differently and the old files were never removed; nearly all
of them are byte-identical to a document that IS indexed under another id.

Rules (see the design note of 2026-09-03):

* an orphan whose sha256 is owned by a manifest row is a **duplicate** → moved
  to ``raw_orphans/<same relative path>`` (``os.replace``, same filesystem);
* any other orphan is **unindexed** → left in place, reported (candidate for
  ``reindex-from-disk``);
* a file whose stem IS a manifest doc_id is never examined, let alone moved;
* the default run is a dry-run: it classifies and reports, moves nothing;
* a file that cannot be hashed (permission error, vanished mid-walk) is
  reported as a failure, never fatal to the sweep, and never moved;
* a duplicate whose owning manifest row's own file is missing from disk is
  never moved — quarantining it would leave zero on-disk copies of that
  document;
* symlinks are ignored: never walked as orphans, never used as a move
  destination.

The manifest is read once, through :func:`storage.iter_manifest_rows` (no
``Storage()`` side effects). On the NAS the run-job global lock guarantees no
concurrent manifest writer; from a workstation over SMB, run it outside the
nightly sync window.
