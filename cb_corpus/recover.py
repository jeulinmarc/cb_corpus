"""`recover-downloads` — inventory-driven Wayback recovery.

Every download that fails ALL of its candidate URLs is durably logged to
``data/download_errors.jsonl`` (``Storage._record_download_error``, live since
PR #6). Most of that inventory is genuinely gone from the bank's own site but
still sitting in the Wayback Machine under its ORIGINAL (now-dead) URL — this
module turns that inventory into recovered documents, the same way
``sources/wayback.py``'s ``WaybackSource``/``run_wayback_recovery`` already do
for hand-picked ``url_prefix`` sweeps, except driven by the audit trail
instead of a CDX prefix walk.

Per entry: skip it if the corpus already converged on it since the failure was
logged (nightly retries fill some gaps on their own); otherwise refresh title/
date from the IDEAS source page when there is one (same honesty as
``sources/repec.py`` discovery: month precision, ``date_source="repec"``);
look up the latest Wayback snapshot of the official URL (falling back to any
alternate URL); dry-run reports it, ``--download`` saves it with
``provenance="wayback"`` and the official bank URL untouched as ``pdf_url``
(citation + stable ``doc_id``) — the raw snapshot is just an ``alt_urls``
fallback ``Storage.save`` tries.

No fuzzy matching anywhere: an entry with no snapshot under any known URL is
reported ``unrecoverable`` and left alone, honestly. When ``--download``
finds a snapshot but ``Storage.save`` reports ``skip:*`` (the bytes
hash-match a doc already in the corpus, or the doc_id was already indexed),
the entry is reported ``duplicate`` -- there is nothing left to recover,
so it is never relabelled ``recoverable`` (which would just re-download the
same duplicate PDF every run).

``--candidates <path>`` switches to a SEPARATE, candidates-only mode (no CDX
walk at all): each JSONL line is an EXTERNALLY-recovered file (hunted by hand
via Wayback / the bank's current site / a legitimate mirror --
recover-quarantine design decision 1/2) --
``{dead_pdf_url, file_path, recovered_from: wayback|bank_site|mirror,
final_url, title?}``. The audit entry is matched by ``dead_pdf_url`` (an
entry with no match is reported ``unknown-entry``, never guessed at); the
already-downloaded local file is verified (``%PDF`` magic, >20KB) before
anything is registered (``bad-file`` otherwise); the resulting ``DocRecord``
follows the provenance rules per ``recovered_from`` (decision 2). Because the
bytes already exist locally, this mode registers them via
``Storage.reindex`` (copy to ``Storage.target_path`` + index, sha256 dedup)
instead of ``Storage.save`` (no network fetch) -- same storage discipline,
never bypassed.

    """Drive the full recover-downloads pass. Dry-run by default: only the CSV
    is written, nothing is downloaded or saved (``--download`` opt-in mirrors
    the rest of the corpus's discovery commands). Returns
    ``{bank_code: {"recoverable": n, "recovered": n, "duplicate": n,
    "unrecoverable": n, "converged": n}}`` -- ``recovered`` only counts
    entries actually saved in ``--download`` mode; ``duplicate`` counts
    ONLY the two exact dedup statuses (``skip:already-indexed``,
    ``skip:duplicate-content``) -- nothing left to recover there, so the CSV
    action is honestly ``duplicate``, not ``recoverable`` (which would keep
    re-downloading the full PDF every run for no gain); any OTHER ``skip:*``
    status is reported verbatim as the CSV action, never mislabeled --
    recovery saves run with ``bypass_quarantine=True`` precisely so the
    quarantine gate (fed by the same ``download_errors.jsonl`` inventory)
    cannot silently block them. A CSV report (``{bank, pdf_url, action,
    snapshot_ts, title}``) is written in both modes so a dry-run's
    classification is never lost, and a CSV line never claims an action that
    didn't happen (a failed ``--download`` save stays ``recoverable``, not
    ``recovered``; its failure lands in ``download_errors.jsonl`` like any
    other, via the audit path).

    ``candidates`` switches to the ``--candidates`` mode (see the module
    docstring): the CDX walk below is skipped ENTIRELY, replaced by
    :func:`_run_candidates_pass`. ``seed_quarantine``, independent of that
    switch, applies a ``--seed-quarantine`` file (:func:`_apply_seed_quarantine`)
    before the pass runs -- it may be combined with either mode, or used
    alone (a ``download_errors.jsonl``-only run with no candidates).
